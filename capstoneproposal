In this capstone project, I propose to develop a Flask-based web application that provides NFL Fantasy Football enthusiasts with a tool to project a player's fantasy statistics for an entire NFL season. Fantasy Football is a popular pastime for sports fans, and this application will cater to the growing demand for accurate player projections to help users make informed decisions when drafting players and setting their fantasy lineups.

Project Objectives
User Registration and Authentication:

Implement user registration and authentication systems to allow users to create accounts and log in securely.
Player Database Integration:

Integrate a comprehensive NFL player database, including player names, positions, teams, and historical performance statistics.
Projection Algorithm:

Develop a robust projection algorithm that takes into account player performance history, team dynamics, schedule, injuries, and other relevant factors to project player statistics (e.g., yards, touchdowns, receptions, etc.) for an entire NFL season.
User Dashboard:

Create a user-friendly dashboard where users can input player names, specify the season, and receive projected fantasy statistics.
Interactive Charts and Visualizations:

Implement interactive charts and visualizations to display projected statistics in an easy-to-understand format, allowing users to compare and analyze players efficiently.
Draft Simulation:

Include a draft simulation feature that assists users in making informed draft choices based on the projected statistics.
User Profiles:

Develop user profiles that track a user's drafted players, past performance, and success rate.
Real-time Updates:

Implement real-time updates for player statistics and projections throughout the NFL season.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the web application is responsive, making it accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Testing and Deployment:

Rigorously test the application to ensure accuracy in projections and a seamless user experience. Deploy the application on a production server for public access.
Technologies and Tools
The project will leverage the following technologies and tools:

Flask: A lightweight and flexible Python web framework for building the backend of the application.
SQLAlchemy: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library to interact with the database.
JavaScript and Charting Libraries: To create interactive charts and visualizations for projected statistics.
NFL API: To access real-time NFL player data and game schedules.
User Authentication: Flask-Login or a similar library for user authentication.
HTML/CSS: For designing the user interface.
Testing Frameworks: Such as pytest for unit and integration testing.
Deployment Platform: A cloud hosting service like Heroku or AWS for deploying the application.
